RESTful API
Representational State Transfer
RESTful API la mot tieu chuan dung trong viec thiet ke cac API cho cac ung dung Web de quan ly cac resource.
Trong tam cua REST la quy dinh cach su dung cac HTTP method va cach dinh dang cac URL cho ung dung Web.
Vi du mot trang blog de quan ly cac bai viet chung ta co cac URL di voi cac HTTP method nhu sau: 
	- URL tao bai viet: http://my-blog.xyz/posts. Thuong ung voi HTTP method là POST
	- URL doc bai viet voi ID la 123: http://my-blog.xyz/posts/123. Thuong ung voi HTTP method là GET

Bandwidth requirements, real-time performance, and memory footprint are some of the main criteria when selecting an IoT protocol

Developers need to be educated that there are better protocol options for IoT devices than IT technologies.
There are multiple categories of IP:
Consumer versus industrial
Web services
IoT services
Publish/subscribe
Request/response
These categories must be considered when designing a new system.


The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. 
The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well.
This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990.
