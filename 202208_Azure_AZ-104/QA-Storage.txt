Storage - Sync
+ ZRS: Replicates synchronously.
+ GRS, RA-GRS: Replicates asynchronously.



//===
You have an on-premises file server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2016.
You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure file share.
You deploy an Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service, and you create a sync group.
You need to synchronize files from Server1 to Azure.
Which three actions should you perform in sequence?
1. Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
2. Create an Azure on-premises data gateway
3. Create a Recovery Services vault
4. Register Server1
5. Add a server endpoint
6. Install the DFS Replication server role on Server1
	A. 1 - 4 - 5
	B. 6 - 5 - 4
	C. 2 - 1 - 5
	D. 3 - 1 - 4
Explanation
Correct Answer: 1 -> 4 -> 5
Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share
Step 2: Register Server1
Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
Step 3: Add a server endpoint
Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.

You plan to create an Azure Storage account in the Azure region of East US 2.
You need to create a storage account that meets the following requirements:
⦿ Replicates synchronously.
⦿ Remains available if a single data center in the region fails.
Replication:
	A. GRS
	B. LRS
	C. RA-GRS
	D. ZRS
Explanation
Correct Answer: D
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your data synchronously across three storage clusters in a single region.
LRS would not remain available if a data center in the region fails
GRS and RA GRS use asynchronous replication

//===
You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following table.
	storage 1	StorageV2		Standard
	storage 2	BlobStorage		Standard
	storage 3	BlockBlobStorage	Premium
	storage 4	FileStorage			Premium
You plan to manage the data stored in the accounts by using lifecycle management rules.
To which storage accounts can you apply lifecycle management rules?
	A. storage 1 only
	B. storage 1, storage 2 only
	C. storage 3, storage 4 only
	D. storage 1, storage 2, storage 3 only
	E. storage 1, storage 2, storage 3, storage 4
Explanation
Correct Answer: D
The lifecycle management feature is available in all Azure regions for general purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts, blob storage accounts, premium block blobs storage accounts, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts.


//=== TEST-4
You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account.
You have an on-premises server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2016. Server1 has 2 TB of data.
You need to transfer the data to the storage account by using the Azure Import/Export service.
In which order should you perform the actions?
1. From the Azure portal, update the import job
2. From the Azure portal, create an import job
3. Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe
4. Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center
Explanation
Correct Answer: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1
Step 1: Prepare the drives (Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe)
Step 2: Create an import job (From the Azure portal, create an import job)
Step 3: Ship the drives to the Azure datacenter (Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center)
Step 4: Update the job with tracking information (From the Azure portal, update the import job)

//===
You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1.
You create an Azure Storage account named contosostorage, and then you create a file share named data.
Which UNC path should you include in a script that references files from the data file share? 
Explanation
Correct Answer: \\contosostorage.file.core.windows.net\data

//===
You have an Azure subscription that contains the file shares shown in the following table.
	share1		WestUS
	share2		WestUS
	share3		EastUS
You have the on-premises file shares shown in the following table.
	data1	Server1		D:\Folder1
	data2	Server1		E:\Folder2
	data3	Server1		E:\Folder2
You create an Azure file sync group named Sync1 and perform the following actions:
⦿ Add share1 as the cloud endpoint for Sync1.
⦿ Add data1 as a server endpoint for Sync1.
⦿ Register Server1 and Server2 to Sync1.

* You can add share3 as an additional cloud endpoint for Sync1 => NO
A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints.

* You can add data2 as an additional server endpoint for Sync1 => YES
Data2 is located on Server2 which is registered to Sync1.

* You can add data3 as an additional server endpoint for Sync1 => NO
Data3 is located on Server3 which is not registered to Sync1.
