Virtual Machine

+ Quota (ex. vCPU) based on the total number of cores in use both allocated and deallocated.
+ DNS server port 53; Web server port 80; RDP port 3389 TCP;
+ While resizing, the VM must be in a stopped state, therefore there will be a downtime.
+ VM and VMSS should be in same resource group and same location.

//===
You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains the quotas shown in the following table.
	Standard BS family vCPUs	WestUS	0 of 20
	Standard D family vCPUs		WestUS	0 of 20
	Total regional vCPUs		WestUS	0 of 20
You deploy virtual machines to Subscription1 as shown in the following table.
	VM1	Standard_B2ms	2 vCPUs		WestUS	Running
	VM2	Standard_B16ms	16 vCPUs	WestUS	Stopped (deallocated)
You plan to deploy the virtual machines shown in the following table.
	VM3	Standard_B2ms	1
	VM4	Standard_D4s_v3	4
	VM5	Standard_B16ms	16
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
	You can deploy VM3 to West US	=> YES
	You can deploy VM4 to West US	=> NO
	You can deploy VM5 to West US	=> NO
Explanation
Total regional vCPUs = 20
2 vCPUs (VM1) + 16 vCPUs (VM20) = 18 vCPUs, which means that only 2 vCPUs left to exceed usage limit.
We can add 1 vCPU. 2 vCPUs (VM1) + 16 vCPUs (VM20) + 1 vCPU (VM3) = 19 vCPUs

//===
You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines that will run Windows Server 2019 in a virtual machine scale set by using an Azure Resource Manager template.
You need to ensure that NGINX is available on all the virtual machines after they are deployed.
What should you use?
	A. the Publish-AzADDscConfiguration cmdlet
	B. Azure Application Insights
	C. Azure Custom Script Extension
	D. the New-AzConfigurationAssignment cmdlet
Explanation
Correct Answer: C
With an Azure Custom Script extension you can push the NGINX installation after VMs are created using the Resource manager template.
Note:
There are several versions of this question in the exam. The question has two correct answers:
1. a Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension
2. Azure Custom Script Extension

You need to ensure that VM1 can be created in an Availability Zone.
Which two settings should you modify?
	A. Use managed disks
	B. OS disk type
	C. Availability options
	D. Size
	E. Image
Explanation
Correct Answer: AC
A. Use managed disks
Your VMs should use managed disks if you want to move them to an Availability Zone by using Site Recovery.
C. Availability options
When you create a VM for an Availability Zone, Under Settings > High availability, select one of the numbered zones from the Availability zone dropdown.
