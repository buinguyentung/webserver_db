Virtual Networks




//===
You have an Azure subscription.
Users access the resources in the subscription from either home or from customer sites. From home, users must establish a point-to-site VPN to access the Azure resources. The users on the customer sites access the Azure resources by using site-to-site VPNs.
You have a line-of-business-app named App1 that runs on several Azure virtual machine. The virtual machines run Windows Server 2016.
You need to ensure that the connections to App1 are spread across all the virtual machines.
What are two possible Azure services that you can use?
	A. an internal load balancer
	B. a public load balancer
	C. an Azure CDN
	D. traffic manager
	E. an Azure Application gateway
Explanation
Correct Answer: AE
Network traffic from the VPN gateway is routed to the cloud application through an internal load balancer. The load balancer is located in the front-end subnet of the application.
A: The customer sites are connected through VPNs, so an internal load balancer is enough.
E: Azure Application Gateway is a valid option, as it provides load balancing in addition to routing and security functions.

Incorrect Answers:
B: The customer sites are connected through VPNs, so there's no need for a public load balancer, an internal load balancer is enough.
C: A CDN does not provide load balancing for applications, so it not relevant for this situation.
D: Traffic manager is a DNS based solution to direct users' requests to the nearest (typically) instance and does not provide load balancing for this situation.

You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that has the contoso.onmicrosoft.com domain name.
You have a domain name of contoso.com registered at a third-party registrar.
You need to ensure that you can create Azure AD users that have names containing a suffix of @contoso.com.
Which three actions should you perform in sequence?
1. Add a record to the public contoso.com DNS zone
2. Add an Azure AD tenant
3. Configure company branding
4. Create an Azure DNS zone
5. Add a custom name
6. Verify the domain
	A. 5 - 1 - 6
	B. 4 - 5 - 1
	C. 1 - 5 - 6
	D. 2 - 4 - 6
Explanation
Correct Answer:  5 -> 1 -> 6
1. Add the custom domain name to your directory
2. Add a DNS entry for the domain name at the domain name registrar
3. Verify the custom domain name in Azure AD

//===
Your on-premises network contains an SMB share named Share1.
You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
⦿ A web app named webapp1
⦿ A virtual network named VNET1
You need to ensure that webapp1 can connect to Share1.
What should you deploy?
	A. an Azure Application Gateway
	B. an Azure AD application proxy
	C. an Azure virtual network gateway
Explanation
Correct Answer: C
A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection can be used to connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel. This type of connection requires a VPN device, a VPN gateway, located on-premises that has an externally facing public IP address assigned to it.

Incorrect Answers:
A: Application Gateway is for http, https and Websocket - Not SMB
B: Not SMB - Application Proxy is a feature of Azure AD that enables users to access on-premises web applications from a remote client.

//===
You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains an Azure virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 connects to your on-premises network by using Azure ExpressRoute.
You plan to prepare the environment for automatic failover in case of ExpressRoute failure.
You need to connect VNet1 to the on-premises network by using a site-to-site VPN. The solution must minimize cost.
Which three actions should you perform?
	A. Create a connection
	B. Create a local site VPN gateway
	C. Create a VPN gateway that uses VpnGw1 SKU
	D. Createa gateway subnet
	E. Create a VPN gateway that uses the Basic SKU
Explanation
Correct Answer: ABC
Vnet1 is already connected by ExpressRoute, which we presume that the subnet gateway was already created.
SKU need to be VpnGw1 because Basic does not coexist with ExpressRoute.

For a site to site VPN, you need:
⦿ a local gateway
⦿ a gateway subnet
⦿ a VPN gateway
⦿ a connection to connect the local gateway and the VPN gateway


//===
You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources in the following table.
	VM1		VM
	VM2		VM
	LB1		Load Balancer (Basic SKU)
You install the Web Server server role (IIS) on VM1 and VM2, and then add VM1 and VM2 to LB1.
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

VM1 is in the same availability set as VM2	=>  YES
Explanation
Correct Answer: A
A Basic Load Balancer supports virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set.
	+ Basic Load Balancer: Virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set.
	+ Standard Load Balancer: Any virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets in a single virtual network.
